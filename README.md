Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice definitely had some trouble. As a group, we kinda did "extra credit" because before the merge madness began, we were already having conflicts before the initial "conflict".

Overall, teams started pulling and merging simultaneously so when another team tried to merge after the other team had already merged, there was already a conflict. After a few improper and unfortunately timed merges, we finally got back on track and was able to resolve the merge conflict.
